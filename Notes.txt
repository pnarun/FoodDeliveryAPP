Two types of Export/Import
1.  Default Export/Import: Works only when you want to export a single Component from a single file.
    - export default Component;
    - import Component from "path";
2.  Named Export/Import: Works when you want to export multiple components from a single file.
    - export const Component;
    - import { Component } from "path";

React Hooks - Normal JS utility functions
    - useState() : popularly used
        - Super powerful State variables in React
        - Whenever a state variable updates, react will re-render the component.
        - useState() returns an array where index 0 has state variable and index 1 has a function which updates the state variable which requires an argument nothing but an updated varible which need to replicate on state variable.
    - useEffect() : less used

React Fiber (Reconciliation Algorithm) - React16
1. Virtual DOM is an Object representation of Actual DOM.
2. Actual DOM is an actual DOM we write.
3. When State variable updates, a new object is formed which compares with Virutal DOM and update the difference on Actual DOM.
4. This is done by Difference Algorithm also known as Reconciliation Algorithm.
